            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>I was tapped to redesign how expense reports were submitted after working with the project sponsor to help establish UX principles for our organization to use.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>This included a redesign of the dashboard so it actually functioned like a dashboard and copious form redesign.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="image right">

    <section class="section">
        <div class="content left">
            <h2>UX</h2>
            <p>I reviewed the user requirements, parsed out which were design related, and began my initial design.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The dashboard was the biggest visual change.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Instead of a largely unutilized space, the page now displayed all pertinent information including updates, instructions, ability to pay any amount owed, options for uploading receipts and creating an expense report and views for expense report status.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Initially I wanted to have the dashboard utilize widgets so everything could be done within it’s allotted space on the page.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There was just too much information required when submitting an expense report to have that approach work and still be a great user experience.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I pivoted to modals for the forms to enhance layout and legibility.</p>
        </div>

    <section class="section">
        <div class="content left">
            <!-- <h2>UX</h2> -->
            <p>I was able to reduce redundancy by removing duplicated links with different names that took you to the same place.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I also ensured click depth was minimized for menu options.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I made sure the forms were clear; drop down menus provided additional detail on what was being selected to reduce error and all required fields were now labeled.</p>

    <section class="section">
        <div class="content left">
            <!-- <h2>UX</h2> -->
            <p>The existing forms were functional of course, however everything was too big or awkwardly occupied the space.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There was no use of a grid for content layout, just an endless scroll of fields you maybe had to fill in.</p>
            <br>
            <p>By implementing columns and collapsible sections, as well as labeling every required field, it made the form less imposing and allowed the user to focus on what was required, adding additional color if needed.</p>

            <!-- <h2>UX</h2> -->
            <p>In addition to the dashboard and forms, I also redesigned the FAQ page to match the rest of the updated site.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I was working with the software engineer who had done the initial UI so I ensured I approached any of my suggested changes delicately and with use cases that backed up what I was suggesting.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This project is currently still active with an anticipated launch at the end of Q2 2025</p>
